<h2>Buying or selling your home in the San Francisco Bay Area?</h2>
<div>
Partnering with a real estate agent who has extensive knowledge of the San Francisco Bay
Area as well as districts, schools, local ordinances, and the current housing market is vital to a
real estate transaction. I will guide you through the complexities of buying or selling, eliminating
hassles and stress. I love helping clients buy and sell their homes and I would love to help you
buy or sell your home.
</div>
<h2>You need a local expert working for you</h2>
<div>
With my expert knowledge of the local real estate market, I know how to help you with your
unique needs and protect your best interests through every aspect of a real estate transaction. I
am focused on providing you with the most personal attention and best service available.<br/><br/>
The Internet is a great place to find information. But it can&apos;t provide the in depth local knowledge
and personalized service of a local real estate professional. The challenges of the real estate
industry are getting more complex every day. You need a professional that is on top of the
market and is prepared to protect your interests and guide you throughout the process. As a
local real estate expert I am constantly researching the market and analyzing home prices so I
can serve you with the latest and most accurate information.<br/><br/>
For most families, buying or selling a home is one of the biggest decisions you&apos;ll ever make. I&apos;d
be honored for the chance to help you.
</div>
<h2>Get the Best Price for Your Home</h2>
<div>
The market will set the price of your home. Based on your homes square footage,
bedrooms/baths, land and location and the sales price of comparable homes in your area you
can begin to estimate what the best listing price will be. Knowing what is happening in the
market that week and seeking qualified experienced guidance is your best defense against
mispricing and ultimately getting less when your home ultimately sells.<br/><br/>
Pricing a property too low is generally not a concern, as there is currently a back log of potential
buyers who actively seek under priced properties and as long as you give your home enough
time on the multiple listing service and allow brokers and potential buyers to see your home, you
will receive multiple offers. The advice and guidance a professional can give you in negotiating
the highest possible price in a multiple offer situation is priceless.<br/><br/>
However, did you know that pricing a home just 5% over the market, according to statistics; will
result in loosing 50% of your potential buyers? The internet has made it even more critical to
price accurately. If 87% of Bay Area buyers search on the internet, they put in value ranges and
only look at homes within that value. They do not look at homes in the range above and wonder
if the sellers will accept less. <b>Buyers shun overpriced properties and statistics say homes
ultimately sell much lower if they are price incorrectly in the beginning. In a declining
market this effect can be intensified.</b><br/><br/>
There are three items that are part of a successful sale and achieving the highest possible price.
I like to envision a three legged stool: <b>(1)</b> Seller motivation <b>(2)</b> Broker marketing <b>(3)</b> Price. With
all three working you will obtain the highest possibles price. When just one comes up short, the
stool is wobbly and ultimately will fall over.
